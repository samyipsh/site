- A platform for users to pair up and solve programming algorithm questions to skill-up for technical interviews. It matches users based on selected criteria (difficulty and topic). It allows them to choose an algorithm question, code it in a code editor that runs in a sandboxed environment, communicate via a chatroom, and get assistance from an AI chatbot.
