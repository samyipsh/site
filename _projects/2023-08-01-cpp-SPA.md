- Program to parse in a simplified programming language (“_SIMPLE_”), generate and store necessary information in appropriate data structures in database, and then support querying relationships within source code. Consists of 3 main subsystems, the Source Parser, the Program Knowledge Base, and the Query Processor.
- Guided Group Project (6 members) in *CS3203 Software Engineering Project* across *3 months*

 Learnt basics of C++ within 2 weeks and utilized it, following best practices (e.g. for header files, “using” namespaces, etc.).
- Utilized basics of parsing (Lexing, Tokenizing, Abstract Syntax Tree generation)
- Used different kinds of Bi-directional Mappers (1-to-1, 1-to-many, many-to-many) to efficiently store query relationship data to support queries.
- Weighed key design choices using design patterns (Visitor Pattern, Factory Pattern etc.).
- Rigorous documentation of architecture structure, design choices which increased experience with PlantUML sequence and component diagrams.
- Document possible extension details including implementation and feasibility.

**Used**: C++, Catch2 test framework, Scrum practices, Atlassian Confluence & JIRA
