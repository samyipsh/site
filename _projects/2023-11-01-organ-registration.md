- SPA Web app that provides a 2-way data-binding of URL state to the stops on the Organ instrument
- Prototyped in short span of a few days
- Personally had this issue with storage of organ registration stops. It was a struggle to store, search a consistent format in excel. Also wanted to try out Vue web framework and be more comfortable with raw HTML and CSS.
- Polled for problems regarding registration from public (organists) sentiment on **facebook** and **reddit**
- Brainstormed problems, possible and current solutions on **miro**
- Prototyped low-fidelity web design on **excalidraw**

**Used**: Vue3, HTML, CSS
