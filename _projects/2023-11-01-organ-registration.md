SPA Web app that provides a 2-way data-binding of URL state to the stops on the Organ instrument. I had an issue with the storage, referencing, and sharing of organ registration stops. I could not find a suitable solution so built my own. I chose the Vue framework to give it a try in the hopes I'd be more comfortable with raw HTML and CSS.
- Polled for problems regarding registration from public (organists) sentiment on **facebook** and **reddit**
- Brainstormed problems, possible and current solutions on **miro** [miro-link](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVNORNUyY=/)
- Prototyped low-fidelity web design on **excalidraw**
- App example with (multiple registrations): [multiple-registrations-example-live-app](https://samyipsh.github.io/organ-registration/?options=1&registrations=M4-1:0:0001000000010011000100000000000001001000000000:Clarinet%20solo~M4-2:0:0001000000010011000001000000000001001000000000:Cor%20Anglais%20solo~:0:0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000:~M4-4:0:1101000001110011000010111100000111001111000100:Stanza%204%20goes%20boom%20boom)
