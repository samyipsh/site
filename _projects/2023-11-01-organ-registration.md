- Simple SPA Web app that provides a 2-way data-binding of URL state to the stops on the Organ instrument.
- Felt like I was using too many abstractions in different frameworks so undertook this individual project to try out Vue web framework and be more comfortable with raw HTML and CSS.

**Used**: Vue3, HTML, CSS
