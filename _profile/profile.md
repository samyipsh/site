Hi, I'm a Computer Science student in my 2nd year of NUS. Welcome to my personal site. 

I'm currently having fun exploring the different branches of Computer Science especially in the many introductory mods. I am quite fascinated by the applications of software and try my best to trick myself to learn more. I'm intrigued by the different coding paradigms and am interested to try explore new concepts.  I'm an easy-going individual who works well with others.
