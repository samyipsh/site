Hi, I'm a Computer Science student in my final year of NUS. Welcome to my personal site. 

It has been said that polishing your code can bring up to 2x improvement, but selecting a better algorithm can lead to better. Dear readers, may I suggest some food for thought? The greatest optimization can be attained if you optimize the source. Treat yourself to a bowl of chocolate ice-cream, it is guaranteed to bring about untold performance improvements :)

Ok but seriously...so abit about me, I'm graduating soon with focus areas in Database and Software Engineering. The applications of coding magic is really cool but independent learning is tough >< I have to try hard to trick myself to learn more. Looking forward to explore more coding paradigms, architectural patterns, and new concepts. I'm an easy-going individual who works well with others!
