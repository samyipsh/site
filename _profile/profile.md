Hi, I'm Samuel! I'm a NUS Computer Science Graduate, and a Software Developer. Welcome! 👋🏻

It is said that polishing your code can bring up to 2x improvement, but selecting a better algorithm can lead to better. Weary programmer 🧔🏻‍♂️, may I suggest some food for thought? Optimize the source to unlock the greatest optimization. A bowl of ice-cream 🍨 brings about untold performance improvements!

Besides crafting deep and inspirational statements such as the above, I enjoy building software applications. It's actually pretty fun and it's my focus area after all 🫠 (other focus area is Database Systems 💾). Coding is great cos you can build lots of cool stuff. I'm trying to get better and have fun at it.

I like listening and reading latest updates about all things software. I'd be doing more web development, lets see how it goes 👀
